## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is designed with a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.

1.  **Frontend**: The user interface, built with React, allows users to upload documents and interact with the platform.
2.  **API Gateway**: Manages all incoming requests from the frontend and routes them to the appropriate backend service. It is built with Node.js and includes a Load Balancer.
3.  **Core Services**: Handles business logic, including User Management, Authentication, and Notifications.
4.  **Document Processing**: Manages file storage and the OCR service for scanned documents.
5.  **ML Pipeline**: The heart of the platform. It takes input documents and runs them through a series of models for parsing, NER, classification, simplification, and risk assessment.
6.  **Data Layer**: A combination of PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for unstructured data, and Redis for caching ensures efficient data management.
7.  **External APIs**: Integrates with third-party services for payments, SMS/Email notifications, and cloud storage.
